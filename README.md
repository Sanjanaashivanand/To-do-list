# To-Do List Application

## Description
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate the use of **local storage** in the browser by creating a simple to-do list application. This app supports basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and allows users to manage their tasks effectively. It's built with minimalistic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on simplicity and functionality.

## Features
- **Create** new tasks and add them to the list.
- **Read** and view tasks saved in the list.
- **Update** existing tasks with new descriptions.
- **Delete** tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can check off tasks as done.
- **Local Storage**: Task data is stored in the browser’s local storage, so the list persists even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Demo Video
Here’s a quick demonstration of the app:
